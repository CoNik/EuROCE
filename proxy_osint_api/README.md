## Customization for EUvsVirus
Although mainly generated from the swagger API definition, the following points must be taken into account:
 * The requirements.txt file did not work, the current version has been tested
 * The classes in models/ need to be checked, as they don't reference eachother
 * The controllers in controllers/ have been change to implement the expected functionality.
 * The github_downloader.py has been added to fetch the latest data from [https://github.com/qcri/COVID19-MAL-Blacklist](https://github.com/qcri/COVID19-MAL-Blacklist)

## Swagger Generation overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a swagger-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage
